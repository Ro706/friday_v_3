# Friday v3

Friday v3 is a Python-based voice recognition and text-to-speech application. This project uses the `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries to listen to audio input from the microphone, convert it to text, and then speak it back to the user.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Uses Google's speech recognition to convert audio to text.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts recognized text to speech using the `pyttsx3` library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ro706/friday_v_3.git
cd friday_v_3
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3
```

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to start the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will listen for your voice input and repeat back what you said.
